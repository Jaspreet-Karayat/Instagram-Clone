# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaspreetKarayat

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as I learn to build websites and web applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Skills

### 1. **HTML**
- I use HTML to structure web pages with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and forms.

### 2. **CSS**
- I style web pages with CSS to make them look attractive. I use colors, fonts, and layouts to design responsive web pages.

### 3. **JavaScript**
- I use JavaScript to make web pages interactive, like adding click events or updating content without reloading the page.

### 4. **Responsive Design (Media Queries)**
- I use media queries to make sure web pages look good on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers.

### 5. **Bootstrap**
- I use Bootstrap to quickly build responsive websites with ready-made components like buttons, navigation bars, and forms.

### 6. **React.js**
- I am learning React.js to build dynamic, single-page applications. React helps me manage the content on the page in a more efficient way.

## ðŸ“‚ Project

###  **Flipkart Clone**
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Media Queries, Font Awesome
- **Description:** This project is a clone of the popular social media platform Instagram, built using modern web development technologies. The aim of this project is to recreate the core UI and features of Instagram, focusing on responsive design, dynamic content, and a polished user interface, featuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. I used HTML for the structure, CSS and Bootstrap for layout and styling, and JavaScript for adding basic interactivity, Font Awesome was used for icons (search, user, etc.). The project also includes media queries to ensure a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
